			<p class="post-contents">My name is David, I am a full-time college student and worker. I enjoy programming, editing photos/videos, and I love music. Music is easily one of my biggest passions, I listen to it constantly. I mostly listen to metalcore but I like all sorts of genres. My overall goal in life is to make others happy.</p>

			<h5 class="post-title">Get to know GHØST</h5>
			<p class="post-contents">I started taking pictures for Halloween in 2019. I was really happy with the results so the following year in 2020 I made a new set of pictures which turned out to be amazing. The picture to the left is me after a lot of editing and dressing up of course. I was aiming to look like the vocalist of the band ‘GHØSTKID’, and I succeeded at that and even got the vocalist to share my post on his Instagram. Later that year I decided to start streaming on Twitch under the name ‘TheGhostInTheCorner’ which was a combination of two bands I like; The Gloom In The Corner &amp; GHØSTKID. Eventually people started to refer to me as Ghost and I just sort of went with it.</p>
